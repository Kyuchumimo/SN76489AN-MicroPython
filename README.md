MicroPython v1.17+ library for SN76489AN + SN74HC595N hardware music playback.

Supports Master System .VGM (v1.50) files from DefleMask Legacy.
To import the .VGM files please use Thonny IDE.

You can use a PWM signal (3584229 Hz, 50% Duty cycle) as a clock signal without any problem.

## Example
```
import time
import music76489

music = music76489.Music76489()

music.load_vgm("boss_battle.vgm")

while True:
    delta = time.ticks_us()
    music.tick()
    time.sleep_us(16666-time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_us(), delta))
```

## Known issues
If your music contains periodic noise, the pitch will sound one note up.
This problem is perhaps due to the fact that the SN76489AN chip uses a 15-bit shift register for periodic noise / arbitrary duty cycle instead of 16-bit as in the Sega Master System.
