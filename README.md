MicroPython library for SN76489AN + SN74HC595N hardware music playback.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC8a8s6aKmg

Supports Sega Master System .VGM (v1.50) files from DefleMask Legacy.
To import the .VGM files please use Thonny IDE.

You can use a PWM signal (3584229 Hz, 50% Duty cycle) as a clock signal without any problem.

## Example
```py
import time
import music76489

music = music76489.Music76489()

music.load_vgm("boss_battle.vgm")

try:
    while True:
        delta = time.ticks_us()
        music.tick()
        time.sleep_us(16666-time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_us(), delta))
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    music.reset()
    raise KeyboardInterrupt()
```

## Known issues
If your music contains periodic noise, the pitch will sound one note up.
This problem is perhaps due to the fact that the SN76489AN chip uses a 15-bit shift register for periodic noise / arbitrary duty cycle instead of 16-bit as in the Sega Master System.
